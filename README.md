# FT8-Helper-3.0.1

Important notes!

This version is the first "final" release:

When downloading the exe file, virus-alarm might occur. This is a false alarm. The FT8-Helper software use macro commands. Most virus checker cannot distinguish harmless and harmful macros, althought they are not encrypted. Upload and check the software to virustotal.com. You can trust the software. Be sure using the original WSJTX! There are clones in circulation using the same version-number as the origianl WSJTX. It will not work!

new in v3.0.1-2

    Bands can be selected in FT8-Helper. These settings override the band selection in WSJT-X.
    In WSJT-X, the band buttons must be enabled.

new in v3.0.1-1

    Requires the GA-Version WSJT-X v3.0.1.  No other changes

new in v2.7.0-0

    Requires the GA-Version WSJT-X v2.7.0.  No other changes

new in v2.6.1-8

    Prompt-Call list: Entering wanted stations into this list, the stations will be preferred.
    It is similar to the "Wanted Call" list, but it is reachable from the main session, even
    during running S/P operatio, thus there is no need to open the configuration.
    New Strategy "DX-Chasing": This strategy was implemented to call rare DX stations.
    The wanted DX station is to enter into the "Prompt Call" list. It works similar to
    "Only-Wanted" but it starts in split-mode. The user must search and set a free frequency manually.
    After reception of the first CQ or RR73/73 of the wanted DX station, the Helper calls the station
    contionusly and does not stops if the station answers to another station. This is the so-called
    "Pitbull QSO" mode. During the QSO attempt all other stations are ignored.
    
    New field, QSO-with: shows the callsign of the current QSO

==========================================================================

The FT8-Helper program was developed as macro extension for WSJT-X using the Quick-Macros program.
Comparing to other FT8-Robot programs, the FT8-Helper is more “intelligent”, it interprets the received
messages of WSJTX and acts according to the own auto-sequencing and programmable QSO strategy. 
The FT8-Helper is a "portable" software, to start it no installation of Quick-Macros required! Simply copy and start it.

Main Features:

    Works with WSJT-X 2.7.0
    Automatic operation in both "CQ" and "S/P" mode.
    MIX-mode: If no CQ calling stationa are available, it calls CQ
    XCHG-mode: Changes between CQ and S/P automatically with programmable intervals
    Automatic find of free frequency in CQ-mode
    Repeat RR73 if no closing 73 received. Warning if no colsing 73 received.
    Skip-Tx1: calls stations with report instead of QRA-grid.
    CQ=73. When in split-mode, the Helper can call stations sending 73 or RR73.
    Prompt call list for preferred handling the listed stations
    Comfortable set-up of all parameter
    Easy installation
    WSJT-X can start with the -rig-name argument
    Opens the QRZ.com page of the station when starting a QSO
    Counts logged and broken QSOs.
    Shows the average difference between received and transmitted reports.

Various strategies for incoming and outgoing calls:

    Best Priority acording the WSJT-X "Colours" settings.
    Best S/N: If Stations with the same priority received, the one with the best S/N selected
    Only DX: Minimum DX-distance can be specified in Km and Miles.
    Prefer-DX: DX stations are prefered.
    Most distance: Calls the station with the greatest distance.
    Prefer Wanted: prefixes, DXCC-entities and continents can be specified.
    Only Wanted: prefixes, DXCC.entities and continents can be specified
    DX-Chasing: for callng rare DX-stations.
    Exclude stations, prefixes DXCC-entities and continents can be specified
    DXCC entities and prefixes can be excluded for outgoing and for both in/outcoming calls
    Keep-Even/Odd cycle for 6m DX-ing

Band-Hopping:

    Programmable on daily basis
    Two time ranges per day can be programmed
    Operating band, mode, and strategy can be selected.
